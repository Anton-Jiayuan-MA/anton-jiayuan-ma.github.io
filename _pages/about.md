* [[COLING2025]](https://coling2025.org/) [2024] [Detecting Conversational Mental Manipulation with Intent-Aware Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08414)
  * Author: **Jiayuan Ma**\*, [Hongbin Na](https://hongbin-ze.github.io/)\*, [Zimu Wang](https://www.zimuwang.net/), [Yining Hua](https://ningkko.github.io/), Yue Liu, [Wei Wang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=YPHIHq0AAAAJ&hl=en), [Ling Chen](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=L5aYWQcAAAAJ&hl=en)
  * Award: **Best Short Paper**, Oral
  * OSS: Based on Theory of Mind as motivation, a new approach, Intent-Aware Prompting (IAP), was introduced to detect mental manipulation in dialogues, which notably reduces false negatives and improving overall performance on detection.
* [[CLPsych2025]](https://clpsych.org/) [2025] [From Posts to Timelines: Modeling Mental Health Dynamics from Social Media Timelines with Hybrid LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.clpsych-1.21.pdf)

  * Award: Ranked 3rd in the Shared Task
  * OSS: This work proposes a hybrid large language model framework to model individual mental health dynamics by first identifying adaptive and maladaptive evidence in social media posts, and then synthetically generating user well-being scores as well as post-level and timeline-level summaries.
